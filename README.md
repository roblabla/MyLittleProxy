# My Little Proxy
This is not My Little Pony.

How to install :
```bash
git clone git://github.com/roblabla/MyLittleProxy.git
cd MyLittleProxy
git submodule update --init
cd node\_modules/minecraft-protocol
npm install
cd ../../
npm install
```

Once that's done, you'll need to edit index.js's options, and you're done.

```bash
node index.js
```
