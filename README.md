# My Little Proxy
This is not My Little Pony.

How to install :
You first need to install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/). Then all that is needed is : 

```bash
git clone git://github.com/roblabla/MyLittleProxy.git
npm install
```

Once that's done, you'll need to edit index.js's options, and you're done.

```bash
node index.js
```
